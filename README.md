Projects that I have worked on while expanding my knowledge on the python language and its packages.

Malaria-infected cells identification model:

This model was created in google colab through the guidance of an organization known as BigTh!nk AI and involved following the stages of training a model to analyze processed 27,558 200x200 pixel images from New York City hospitals and identifying malaria infection in blood cells. To accomplish this, the data had to be split into separate training/testing sets and optimized after the use of keras neural networks and activation functions with a binomial sigmoid output. A maximum of 5 epochs were used during the training phase with the model classifying each blood cell as either a true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative - the accumulated percentages of each being displayed in a confusion matrix. Although the accuracy percentage ended up only being around 50%, the confusion matrix suggests the issue may have lied with the hidden layers of the model and the structure of the neural networks I created. As my knowledge on machine learning models are still growing, I aim to continue working on more projects with packages such as TensorFlow and pandas in the future.
