# Python-Projects
Projects that I have worked on while expanding my knowledge on the python language and its packages.

Rock Paper Scissors Game:

This project incorporated fundamental and intermediate python syntax and logic in order to create a fake "AI" (mainly just the illusion of an AI) which challenges the user to the ultimate game of Rock Paper Scissors. The code incorporates the timer package and a GUI which displays a win, loss, or a draw at the end of each round. The GUI incorporates the tkinter and pillow package along with the ImageTk and Image modules in order to display PhotoImage objects in the user's window. The number of rounds are determined by the user and the images displayed were found from the internet.

Malaria-infected Cells identification Model:

This model was created in google colab through the guidance of an organization known as BigTh!nk AI and involved following the stages of training a model to analyze processed 27,558 200x200 pixel images from New York City hospitals and identifying malaria infection in blood cells. To accomplish this, the data had to be split into separate training/testing sets and optimized after the use of keras neural networks and activation functions with a binomial sigmoid output. A maximum of 5 epochs were used during the training phase with the model classifying each blood cell as either a true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative - the accumulated percentages of each being displayed in a confusion matrix.
